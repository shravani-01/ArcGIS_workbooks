The two map layers added are,

	1. Hospitals of San Diego by Austin.Phillips_NDU
	2. 2022 USA Diabetes Medication Users (Non-Insulin) by Esri

-Hospitals of San Diego layer:

“The hospitals of San Diego” layer by Austin.Phillips_NDU maps all the hospitals in San Diego. It contains 285 features where it contains columns such as the X and Y points, hospital name, address, city, state, zip, telephone, type and so on based on which it locates the health centers in and around the county and also the legend section directs people to find the specific area of interest they are particularly looking for.

-2022 USA Diabetes Medication Users (Non-Insulin) by Esri: 


“2022 USA Diabetes Medication Users (Non-Insulin)” by Esri segregates various areas in San Diego based on the market potential index that an adult uses non-insulin diabetes prescription drugs in the U.S. in 2022 in a multiscale map (by country, state, county, ZIP Code, tract, and block group). The difference between the areas is evident through the different colors provided in the legend section.

Analysis: 

This analysis shows that the diabetic patients living further away from the hospitals rely on prescription drugs for non-insulin dependent diabetes. However, the market potential index is low for people living near the hospitals as majority of them do not consume medication.  The people who fall under the intersection of both the categories are bound to have an average potential.
